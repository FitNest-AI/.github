# Summary
According to a recent report by the World Health Organization (WHO), a significant number of teenagers worldwide do not engage in regular physical activity. WHO states that around 81% of adolescents and 27.5% of adults fail to meet the minimum recommended physical activity levels for optimal health. WHO provides specific exercise guidelines based on age groups, including muscle-strengthening exercises at least twice a week for older individuals. Engaging in recommended physical activity can help reduce the risk of non-communicable diseases and improve mental well-being. Additionally, research suggests that Generation Z finds it challenging to separate from their smartphones, causing increased anxiety. To address these concerns, a new solution called FitNest has been developed. FitNest combines exercise and smartphone usage, providing various benefits to motivate people, especially Generation Z. These include gamification features, which make fitness goals more enjoyable and rewarding, social media integration to share progress and stay motivated, a variety of workouts and challenges to keep users engaged, and 24/7 accessibility for convenience. FitNest aims to encourage Generation Z to exercise regularly and overcome their dependence on smartphones.
